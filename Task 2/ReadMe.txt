📝 SIMPLE TO-DO LIST APPLICATION
------------------------------------------------------------
This is a beginner-friendly To-Do List project made using Python.
It runs in the command line and helps you manage your daily tasks.

⚙️ Features:
1. View all tasks
2. Add new tasks
3. Remove completed or unwanted tasks
4. Exit the program

🧠 Concepts Used:
- Loops (while)
- Conditional statements (if-elif-else)
- Lists (to store tasks)
- Basic input and output

🏗️ How it works:
- The program keeps running until you choose to exit.
- You can add tasks to a list, view them, or remove them by number.

This project helped me practice Python basics and understand
how to manage data using lists and loops.
